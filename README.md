1. clone this repository.
2. create a branch named according to your first name, in lowercase (with `git checkout`).
3. push that branch to GitHub.
4. make a commit on that branch (create a new file, or modify this one (`README.md`)). don't push to `master` branch.
5. push the commit.
6. switch back to `master` branch on your local repository (with `git checkout`).
